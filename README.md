I'm a student at the University of Stavanger. In 2021, I finished my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, and I'm currently working on my master's in Industrial Economics. The public repos on my GitHub are mostly hobby projects. Check out my [LinkdIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vemund-r-05357597/) and [portfolio website](https://www.refnin.no).
